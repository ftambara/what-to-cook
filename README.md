# what-to-cook

## Description

What to Cook is a small project that intents to help me get ideas for what to cook next. It will load recipes (that you need to pre-load in a file, csv format) in a database (sqlite), tag them according to its ingredients, and let you search through that database by ingredient.

## To-Do

- [ ] Add recipe loading (pre loaded dictionary only).
- [ ] Add dictionary expanding feature.
- [ ] Add search by ingredients.
- [ ] Add UI (Qt).
- [ ] Package and update readme.

### Some ideas
- [ ] Add season tagging
- [ ] Add search by season
